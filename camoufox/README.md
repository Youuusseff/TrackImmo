# TrackImmo Spiders
## This scraping is using scrapy-camoufox library as its foundation please check the camoufox website for more information if you get stuck or reach out to me , or you can check also this repo : https://github.com/adewin/scrapy-camoufox as it helped me to get through a lot in the scraping phase.
### There is just this command that you need to do after installing the conda environment "environment.yml" you will find it in the next folder leboncoin
```bash
cd leboncoin
camoufox fetch
```
### Then just you can go and enjoy your scraping 
```bash
cd spiders
scrapy crawl bienici
```
